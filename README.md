# Computer Graphics

### Description

In the Curricular Unit of Computer Graphics we learned several competences:
* Understand the interconnection of the various modules of a 3D graphic system;
* Design and implement small applications oriented to 3D;
* Design and implement applications with graphical interface, in its various aspects;
* Master scheduling by events.

### Projects 

* During the first project we built a 3D Scene using some graphic computer concepts such as modeling, light, shadows and transformations.
* During the second project we created a fully functional scene consisting of submarine that launches torpedoes to reach the targets.
